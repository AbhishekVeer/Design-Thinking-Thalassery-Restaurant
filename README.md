# Design-Thinking-Thalassery-Restaurant
Thalassery restaurant was facing problem with employee training, and communication gap (linguistic barrier) between customer and service staff which led to bad customer experience and low review (3.5) to restaurant. We provided them with a zero-cost employee training module and a way to integrate local language menu plus online ordering by QR code.
